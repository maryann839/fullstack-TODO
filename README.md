Improvements:
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design:
To improve the task output, we aim to create a more user-friendly design where only the task title is prominently displayed, while additional details are accessible through a dropdown menu. This approach is intended to enhance clarity and organization, preventing unnecessary cluttering of the interface.

Sidebar:
The sidebar currently persists unless the hamburger  is clicked. We plan to implement an improvement where clicking any part of the screen will cause the sidebar to disappear.
